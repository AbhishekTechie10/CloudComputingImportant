  AZURE Networking Basics (Abhishek Veeramalla)
Perfect! Let‚Äôs start from the **basics of networking**‚Äîa solid foundation before diving into Azure VNets or cloud infrastructure. We‚Äôll walk through each concept step-by-step, **with simple examples**, assuming you‚Äôre building up your knowledge from the ground up.

## üß† Networking Basics ‚Äì The Foundation

---

### 1. üî¢ **IP Addressing (IPv4)**

An **IP address** is like the home address of a device in a network.

#### Example:

```plaintext
192.168.1.5
```

* This is a private IP.
* The format is 4 numbers separated by dots (each from 0‚Äì255).
* It‚Äôs a **32-bit address**, divided into:

  * **Network part** ‚Äì identifies the network.
  * **Host part** ‚Äì identifies the device on the network.

---

### 2. üè† **Private vs Public IP**

| Type       | Use Case                            | Example                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Private IP | Used **within** home, office, cloud | `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` |
| Public IP  | Used to access the **internet**     | `8.8.8.8`, `23.45.78.2`                 |

---

### 3. üßÆ **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**

CIDR defines **IP range** using a notation like `/24`, `/16`, etc.

#### Format:

```
<IP address>/<Prefix length>
```

#### Example:

```
10.0.0.0/24
```

* This gives 256 IPs (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255)
* `/24` ‚Üí 8 bits for host (2‚Å∏ = 256)

| CIDR | No. of IPs | Use Case              |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| /30  | 4 IPs      | Point-to-point link   |
| /24  | 256 IPs    | Subnet for small apps |
| /16  | 65,536 IPs | Large networks        |

---

### 4. üõ£Ô∏è **Subnetting**

Subnets break a large network into **smaller segments**.

#### Example:

If you have `10.0.0.0/16`, you can create:

* `10.0.1.0/24` ‚Üí Web Servers
* `10.0.2.0/24` ‚Üí App Servers
* `10.0.3.0/24` ‚Üí DB Servers

This isolates traffic and improves security and routing.

---

### 5. üß± **Gateways**

A **gateway** is like a router that connects different networks.

* Your home Wi-Fi router is a gateway to the internet.
* In Azure, **VPN Gateway** connects your VNet to on-premises.

---

### 6. üö¶ **Firewall & Security Groups**

These control **who can access what**.

| Type     | Description                          | Example                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Firewall | Global traffic inspection (layer 7)  | Block malware, monitor logs    |
| NSG      | Rule-based access at subnet/VM level | Allow port 80 to web servers   |
| ASG      | Grouping of VMs by role              | Group all DB VMs into `asg-db` |

---

### 7. üß≠ **Routing (Static & Dynamic)**

Routing defines **where packets go**.

* **Default Route**: Send unknown traffic to the internet
* **Custom Route**: Send DB traffic to a firewall

---

### 8. üì¶ **Ports and Protocols**

Each service uses a **port number**.

| Protocol | Port | Service |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| TCP      | 80   | HTTP    |
| TCP      | 443  | HTTPS   |
| TCP      | 3389 | RDP     |
| TCP      | 22   | SSH     |

Think of it like apartment numbers in a building (IP is building, port is door).

## üß© Real-Life Example ‚Äì Your Office Network

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre setting up a basic network for your office:

* **IP range**: `192.168.1.0/24` ‚Üí 256 IPs
* **Router**: 192.168.1.1 (default gateway)
* **Devices**:

  * Admin Laptop: 192.168.1.10
  * Web Server: 192.168.1.20
  * Database Server: 192.168.1.30

### Rules:

* Allow Admin Laptop to access DB via port 1433 (SQL)
* Allow Internet to access Web Server via port 80
* Block Internet from accessing DB

## ‚úÖ Summary of Basic Networking Concepts

| Concept    | Purpose             | Example             |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| IP Address | Identifies a device | 192.168.0.10        |
| Private IP | Internal network    | 10.0.0.5            |
| CIDR       | IP range size       | /24 = 256 IPs       |
| Subnet     | Divide network      | WebSubnet, DBSubnet |
| Gateway    | Connects networks   | Router IP           |
| NSG        | Allow/block traffic | Allow port 80       |
| ASG        | Group VMs logically | `asg-web`, `asg-db` |
| Ports      | Identify services   | 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH) |

### üöÄ Up Next

We can now build on this foundation by diving into **Azure-specific networking** using these concepts, starting with **Azure Virtual Networks (VNet)**, Subnets, NSGs, and ASGs in context.

Would you like to proceed with Azure VNet setup based on these basics?
